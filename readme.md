# BEEP BEEP BOOP

Beep Beep Boop is a friendly Twitter bot who finds tweets asking, "are you a robot", then replies to the inquiring individual with extremely convincing arguments to the contrary. It was an introductory project to familiarize myself with Node/Express, asynchronous code, and API consumption.

### Things It Does:

* Finds tweets asking about whether or not a user is a robots, follows the user, and tweets a response
* Responds to responses with an extremely naive language parser to decide if the response was rude, a question, or something else
* Retweets tweets about robots that include links
* Gets into endless conversations with other Twitter bots
* Follows back!
